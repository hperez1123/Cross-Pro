# Cross - Promote (xp)
======
Cross - Promote, or xp for short, is intended to be a social media website for, primarily, small businesses to connect with each other. This app will allow b2b, or business to business accounts check each others services in different industries, and collaborate.

## Mission Statement
======
xp believes it would be most advantageous for small businesses to connect with each other. Mutual benefit, a win - win situation for everyone is the goal. In an a few example of a chocolate company and coffee company, collaborating with other each other can dramatically help cut costs in both advertise and shipping. Laboratories can easily find specialized shipping companies that can help them send delicate and time-sensitive biological samples anywhere around the world. Manufacturing companies can find logistical companies to control movement and storage of goods at a fair price. This project exists to help connect directors and managers from different companies more easily than before. We want our users to know that they have **options**. 

## MVP & Post MVO
